## Learning Goals

1.  Utilize ChatGPT to generate Python program to solve a linear system of four equations and four unknowns,
1.  Implement ChatGPT generated Python program
1.  Calculate solution of four equations and four unknowns using SciPy Linear Algebra library


## Your Solution

### Cell 1 (Markdown)

Update your personal information found in the first cell that is a Markdown cell.

### Cell 2 (Markdown)

In cell 2 (Markdown cell), enter the prompt that you used in ChatGPT to create the Python code. A suggested prompt is "write a python program to solve a linear system of four equations and four unknows using the row echelon method". 

### Cell 3 (Code Cell)

In cell 3 (code cell), enter the Python code that ChatGPT generated and print the solution.

### Cell 4 (Code Cell)

In cell 4 (code cell), write a program to implement the SciPy Linear Algebra to solve the problem created in cell 2 and solved in cell 3. Verify that the answers are the same.
